About:

FastAttach is a simple LD_PRELOAD library for making "gdb -p <pid>" attach to
processes more rapidly. It accomplishes this by attaching to the process as soon
as the library is loaded and tricking GBD into believing that it's subsequent
ptrace() call succeeded.


Compiling:

Right now you need to do this manually using compiler options like this...

gcc fastattach.c -o libfastattach.so -fPIC -DPIC --shared -Wl,--init,fastattach -Wl,--strip-all -ldl


Using:

The compiled libfastattach.so parses the gdb command line arguments. To use it,
you need only preload the library...

LD_PRELOAD=/full/path/to/libfastattach.so /usr/bin/gdb -p <pid>
